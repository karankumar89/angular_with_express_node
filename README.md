Q: Do you find the code to be simpler when using AngularJS? If so, how? If not, why?
	I find the code to be simpler, as its easy to use objects in the html/jade pages without using any script tags. Hence the DOM is easier to modify.

Q:Would a beginner to front-end development find the code to be simpler? Why or why not
	A beginner would find the code a little difficult if he/she is not familiar with MVC frameworks. As it involves few hierarchy stages to be understood before implementing the angular models and controllers.

Q:How might the structure provided by AngularJS simplify building larger web applications?
	AngularJS is more of a front-end framework and easy to scale up applications without modifying much code. Using angular-generator from the npm, its easy it integrate it with node-express framework and create models and controls from the command-line.
